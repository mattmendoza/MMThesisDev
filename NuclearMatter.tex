\section{Hot versus Cold Nuclear Matter}
Because the deconfinement corresponds to a condition where the temperature of the system is above some critical temperature it is often called "Hot Nuclear Matter." Therefore, the region of the nuclear matter phase diagram where quarks and gluons are confined to baryon and meson states is often called "Cold Nuclear Matter." Historically, "Hot" QGP systems were those created by colliding two large nuclei such as in Au+Au collisions and "Cold Nuclear Matter" systems were studied by colliding smaller nuclei with large ones such as in d+Au collisions.

\section{The Cronin Effect}
The seminal paper titled \textbf{Production of hadrons at large transverse momentum at 200, 300, and 400 GeV} by J.W. Cronin, et al. detailed a fixed target experiment that collided protons with a tungsten target and observed a phenomenon which typified cold nuclear matter systems. Later dubbed the \textit{Cronin Effect} after the paper's first author, the experiment found that the production of protons at mid $p_{T}$ ($2\leq p_{T} \leq 4$) was enhanced when compared to the production of pions \citep{croninpaper}. Figure \ref{fig:croninration} shows the production ratio of protons to pions over a range of transverse momentum. In order to measure how nuclear matter affects particle production compared to small systems, they defined a quantity called the \textit{number of effective nucleons} (A), with the limiting case of A=1 meaning p+p like collisions. The closed circle markers show the data from 23.7 GeV proton collisions on a fixed tungsten (A=110) target. The open circles show the same data extrapolated to the lower limit of p+p like collisions.

After this discovery many set out to come up with theoretical mechanisms that could explain this baryon production preference. These mechanisms can largely be categorized into two types: those where the incoming partons interact with the nuclear medium and those where outgoing partons created after an incoming nucleon hard scatters interacts with the nuclear medium. These two categories are called \textit{Initial State Interactions} and \textit{Final State Interactions.}

\subsection{Initial State Multiple Scattering}
The first attempts at explaining the Cronin Effect were made using initial state interactions. K\"{u}hn in 1975 described a mechanism where incoming partons scatter on nuclear partons, randomizing the direction of the incoming parton before finally colliding with a nuclear quark to produce an event similar to a proton-proton collision\citep{PhysRevD.13.2948} (see fig. \ref{fig:ISIscattering}). Since it is unclear how many "soft scatters" happen before the final hard scatter the $p_{T}$ spectrum is broadened which could account for the increase of particle production for the mid $p_{T}$ range.

\end{figure} 

The NA10 collaboration at CERN set out to use back to back lepton probes to study the effect of the nucleus on jets. They collided 140 GeV and 258 GeV negative pions on tungsten targets of various thicknesses and looked for muon pairs produced via a Drell-Yan Process (see fig. \ref{fig:DYfeynman}).

  \label{fig:DYfeynman}
\end{figure}

They found that the mean squared $p_{T}$ did not vary much at all as a function of target thickness which implies that incident partons are not affected by the thickness of the target and therefore that the path length of soft collisions that would broaden the $p_{T}$ spectrum is very short. Furthermore, the E772 collaboration, with an experiment colliding 800 GeV protons on H$_{2}$, C, Ca, Fe, and W targets, showed that Drell-Yan produced dileptons’ mean squared $p_{T}$ did not vary much between the nuclear targets of varying nucleon number.\citep{PhysRevLett.66.2285} i.e. increasing the number of nucleons does not change the net $p_{T}$ much, further showing that initial state contributions to $p_{T}$ broadening is minimal.

As they travel away from the vertex where they were formed they create other colored objects around them in a manner that the net color charge of all particles in the group is colorless. Each group of colorless particles is called a \textit{jet}. Since one jet forming quark is created going one direction, often another is formed going the opposite direction in order to conserve quantum numbers and momentum. This other quark in turn goes on to form its own jet in the same manner. This pair of jets is often referred to as a \textit{dijet}.}

In 1991 the E609 collaboration at Fermilab studied phenomena in experiments that collided 400 GeV/c protons with targets made of various nuclear materials including hydrogen and lead\citep{Corcoran:1990vq}. The conditions of interest to them were the creation of two back to back jets produced after an incoming parton hard scattered with a target nucleon. 
They defined a quantity called \textit{planarity} which measured how \textit{back-to-back} two jets are. In their words:
\begin{addmargin}[1.5em]{2em}
``An axis is found which maximizes the sum of the squares of all momentum components ($b_{max}$) along that axis while minimizing the sum of the squares of momentum components perpendicular to that axis ($b_{min}$). Planarity is then defined as: 
\begin{equation}
P = \frac{b_{max}-b_{min}}{b_{max}+b_{min}}.
\end{equation}
For two narrow back-to-back jets, P approaches 1, while for a circularly symmetric event P is 0.''
\end{addmargin}

  \label{fig:e609planarity}
\end{figure}
Their measurement (fig. \ref{fig:e609planarity}) compared the planarity of dijets created from protons colliding with a hydrogen target with the planarity of those created with collisions on a lead target. They noticed a downward shift in planarity and broadening of the spectrum for Pb dijets compared to H although both had very similar jet widths. This measurement led to a paper in 1993 where they concluded that “Parton hard scatterings within nuclei involve very little nuclear scattering of the incident parton, but that there is substantial nuclear rescattering of outgoing hard scattered partons.\citep{PhysRevLett.70.143}” Because of this, we call this type of mechanism a \textit{Final State Interaction} (for example see fig. \ref{fig:FSIscattering}). While it is true that this could account for the increase in particle production it does not effectively explain why the effect is stronger for baryons than for mesons and why this preference disappears for at high $p_{T}$

\section{Hot Nuclear Matter: QGP}
So far this discussion has stayed within the temperature regime where quarks and gluons are confined to hadronic states. As summarized in the previous chapter, physicists had already seen enough hints that new physics was taking place when the energy density reached some critical value and consequently RHIC was commissioned to study this phase change.

\subsection{Baryon Enhancement}

\end{figure}

One of the surprises encountered when studying this new phase of matter was that the production of particles seemed to have a different mechanism compared to p+p collisions. One experimental signature of this was the so called \textit{baryon enhancement} for peripheral Au+Au collisions \citep{PhysRevLett.97.152301}. This result is shown in figure \ref{fig:ppiratiocentvsperiph} which shows the comparative yield between protons and pions in bins of $p_{T}$. The phenomena of interest is the apparent baryon excess in central collision data set for the mid $p_{T}$ range which is strongest at around $p_{T}\approx$ 2 GeV/c and disappears at around $p_{T}\approx$ 4 GeV/c. Similarly, the Nuclear Modification factor for Central and Peripheral collisions also shows this enhancement in the same range (shown in figure \ref{fig:Rcpcentvsperiph}).

\subsection{Theoretical Models of Baryon Enhancement}
Though many have proposed models to describe this baryon enhancement, I will focus this discussion on a handful of leading models.

\subsubsection{Recombination and Fragmentation}
Following the idea that a phase change in nuclear matter happens when a critical energy density causes deconfinement of quarks and gluons from their bound states as neutrons and protons and that the post-collision evolutionary behavior of this QGP is one that expands rapidly, Rudolph Hwa and C.B. Yang postulated that the enhancement of particle production could be explained by the ways in which the outgoing partons interacted\citep{PhysRevC.70.024905}. They defined two momentum classifications for outgoing partons: those with low transverse momentum (in the hundreds of MeV/c) created by the collective thermal expansion of the QGP which they referred to as \textit{soft} partons, and \textit{hard} partons with high transverse momentum created by hard nuclear scattering processes. Since these hard partons result in jet formation, and jets are comprised of a shower of particles, they use the terminology \textit{shower parton} to describe these hard scatter produced partons. The production of particles could then be described by the way these partons combined combinatorially, i.e. the way thermal partons combined with other thermal partons, the way they combined with hard partons, and the way hard partons combined with other hard partons. This mechanism was termed \textit{recombination} since it relied on the recombining of quarks in partons created from the nuclear collision.

\caption[Recombination model compared with Au+Au data]{Au+Au identified particle measurements compared with recombination model predictions.

This occurs with enough energy to create antiparticle partners from the vacuum resulting in the formation of charged pions.}
  \label{fig:fragmentationdiag}
\end{figure} 
Fries, M{\"u}eller, Nonaka, and Bass simplified this picture, postulating that the the reason why protons were produced in abundance was simply that following a collision, the building blocks of protons: up and down quarks, are plentiful and that they simply recombine back into their confined states. This mechanism dominates for low $p_{T}$ since outgoing partons are traveling slowly enough that the constituent quarks to remain connected due to color confinement. In contrast to the soft partons, partons created with hard scattering processes are more likely to have enough energy to briefly break color confinement, briefly isolating quarks which then create jets of quark/anti-quark pairs, i.e. mesons. The process of breaking up 3 quark states into quark-antiquark states was then termed \textit{fragmentation}. This two regime model naturally creates a baryon preference for low $p_{T}$ partons that is met with proportional meson production when the parton $p_{T}$ is adequately high enough.

\section{Flow at the LHC}
Up till now it appeared that the lines in the proverbial sand were clear with respect to nuclear matter phase changing and that we had two distinct ways to measure the properties of these two states. On the one side there was cold hadronic matter which had its own experimental signatures that could be observed in the collisions of light ions with heavy ones (such as d+Au). On the other hand, there was hot, deconfined, quark matter which behaved another way and was measured using collisions of two heavy nuclei (as in Au+Au). This notion that the two experimental methods allowed the temperature dependent phenomena to be studied separately was brought into question in 2015 when the \textit{Large Hadron Collider} (LHC) at CERN turned on and entered its second era of measurements. At the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) they collected data from p+Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV and compared it to Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV. While hydrodynamic phenomena like collective flow was expected in the Pb+Pb data, they found the unexpected when a nonzero elliptic flow was measured in p+Pb (see fig \ref{fig:pPbflow}).

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{prevplots/pPbflowLHC.JPG}

  \caption[Elliptic Flow in p+Pb at the LHC]{CMS result from 5.02 TeV p+Pb collisions showing a nonzero elliptic flow signal versus track multiplicity}
  \label{fig:pPbflow}
\end{figure} 

The appearance of flow in systems previously thought of as ``cold'' was a sign that perhaps the QGP forms much more easily than was previously expected and that perhaps some phenomena found in cold systems, such as baryon enhancement, could be attributed to mechanisms that found favor in explaining similar phenomena in hot heavy ion systems.

\section{Recombination and Fragmentation for All?}
Furthermore, experimental evidence that the two systems behave quite similarly has been found. In fig. \ref{fig:daaaratios} particle production ratios ($p/\pi$) are compared and we see that the baryon enhancement which was indicative of the QGP formation in peripheral Au+Au collisions is followed extremely closely by data from central d+Au. 

\begin{figure}[htbp!]

  \label{fig:daaaratios}
\end{figure} 

The quantity \textit{centrality} will be discussed further in \ref{sect:centrality} but it simply describes how ``head-on'' a collision is. For instance, a collision where two ions collide perfectly head-on is called a \textit{central} collision, whereas if they were just to barely glance each other it would be called a \textit{peripheral} collision. It may seem that the behavior of the two are contradicting since the effect happens in central events for one system and in peripheral events in the other, but we can see from inspection that the two cases are similar. In the Cronin result, a quantity called the number of effective nucleons described the number of nucleons that interacted in a system. If we make the hypothesis that the formation of a QGP is most likely with a higher number of interacting nucleons then it follows that if a QGP were to be formed in d+Au, it would be most likely to form in central collisions. And so, since physicists love reductionism and unification, and that the evidence makes one wonder if a QGP is formed in these simpler systems, it would be advantageous to be able to describe the two systems with a singular mechanism.

But are there even the building blocks to support such a notion that QGP is created in such a simple system as d+Au? Recombination is easy to justify in Au+Au since the large number of interacting nucleons makes the formation of the QGP easily achieved and leaves a great abundance of free quarks that are able to recombine. Could there be analogous members at work in the d+Au system? 
\begin{figure}[b!]

  \caption[Pion transverse momentum distribution from d+Au collisions compared to one created with the recombination model]{Pion transverse momentum distribution from d+Au collisions compared to one created with the recombination model}
  \label{fig:daaaratios}
\end{figure}
Hwa and Yang set out to adapt their recombination model to fit the phenomena in d+Au\citep{PhysRevLett.93.082302}. They asserted that since hard scattering creates jets, as jets traverse the nuclear medium it generates a lot of soft outgoing partons. They argue that these soft partons could behave like an expanding QGP, that is to say, they behave like the thermal partons in Au+Au collisions. Since thermal parton recombination seems to explain baryon enhancement well, and if soft partons behave like thermal partons, could there recombination in d+Au as well? Additionally, if there is, could it be a sign that we should see other signs of QGP formation such as collective flow? 

I postulate that there is sufficient evidence to say that the nuclear matter created by d+Au behaves collectively and that there should be a non-zero elliptic flow measurement. Furthermore, this elliptic flow is dependent on particle species in that it exhibits baryon enhancement in the mid $p_T$ range indicative of the formation of a QGP. Unknown phenomena of interest is the enhancement of strangeness. Proton and pion flow is an indicator of first generation quark recombination however strange quarks are not part of the initial conditions and are rather created ``fresh'' from the QGP.  Evidence of strangeness enhancement via kaon flow independent of quark scaling may be further evidence of QGP formation in the previously thought-to-be cold d+Au system. Due to system geometry, flow effects should be maximal with the most central collisions since they create the most interaction of nuclear material. Furthermore, as the collisions become more peripheral, the behavior of the system should become more p+p like.
