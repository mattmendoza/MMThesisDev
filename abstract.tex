It is well known that the novel state of matter known as the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) created at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) suppresses high transverse momentum jets.  A study of the baryon-to-meson production ratio in Au+Au collisions has shown a clear increase in the intermediate pT region for central Au+Au collisions indicative of the production of a QGP.  PHENIXâ€™s Time of Flight detector, used in conjunction with the Aerogel Cherenkov Counter, can provide particle identification with good proton/meson separation for $p_T<10$ GeV/c.  I will present studies of particle identified two particle production using these detectors in a di-jet correlation analysis which could help to elucidate the underlying physics of the baryon excess anomaly.
